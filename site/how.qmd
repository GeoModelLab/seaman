title: "How it works"
---

SEAMAN translates **global, monthly climate data** (1984–2024, NASA-POWER) into a **nocturnal seascape with sound**.  
Each element corresponds to a climate variable or anomaly, mapped through **percentiles** to show departures from the long-term norm.

---

### 🌊 Sea — *temperature anomalies*
- **24 waves**: 12 for monthly **Tmax**, 12 for **Tmin** (Jan at bottom → Dec at top).  
- **Color**: white/ice-blue = cold, median = blue, yellow/orange/red = hot anomalies.  
- **Speed**: calm = near-normal, faster = stronger anomaly.  
- **Direction**: below-median → flows right→left; above-median → left→right.

---

### 🌕 Moon — *precipitation*
- **Annual precipitation** → moon’s **size** (larger = wetter, smaller = drier) and **vertical position**.  
- **12 rings**: width = each month’s share of rainfall; **color** = anomaly percentile (pink = dry, green = wet).

---

### ⭐ Stars — *aridity & climate stress*
- **12 stars** (Jan→Dec, left→right) = monthly **aridity index** \((ET₀ - P)/(ET₀ + P)\).  
- **Vertical position & hue**: lower/blue = wetter months; higher/yellow = drier months.  
- **Halos**: larger/brighter = wetter percentile.  
- **Shape**: regular = near/below-average temps; spiky/distorted = hot anomalies.

---

### 🌌 Sky — *annual warmth*
- **Color & brightness** mirror the annual **temperature anomaly**.  
- **Star count** grows with higher temperature percentiles:  
  - Cold years → dark, sparse skies.  
  - Warm years → pale, star-filled skies.

### 🎧 Soundscape — *hearing the climate*
- **Tempo** accelerates from 80 → 130 bpm as annual warmth increases.  
- **Drum & synth layers** gradually activate under hotter anomalies.  
- **Stars as notes**: pressing `1–0, O, P` plays pitches mapped to monthly aridity.  
- **Distortion** increases with warm anomalies, producing harsher tones.

SEAMAN combines these **visual metaphors + generative soundscape** to foster both **intuitive interpretation** and **emotional resonance** with climate variability.
