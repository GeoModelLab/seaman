## Overview
SEAMAN (Synthesized EArth Monthly ANomalies) is a dual-interface climate visualization tool developed in [VL](https://visualprogramming.net/) within the [vvvv](https://vvvv.org/) environment, running on the .NET ecosystem.  
- **VL** is a node-based language for visual dataflow, real-time interaction, and multimedia.  
- **vvvv** provides the development environment widely used in interactive art, design, and prototyping.  

SEAMAN transforms **NASA-POWER climate data (1984–2024)** into **immersive visual and auditory metaphors** for science communication and education.  

Two main panes structure the tool:  
- **Navigation Pane**: map interaction, geoclimatic metadata, anomaly charts, and a short generative poem.  
- **Representation Pane**: a digital seascape (sea, moon, stars, sky) rendered with sound, encoding temperature, precipitation, aridity, and anomalies.

## Data
- **Source**: [NASA-POWER](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/) monthly gridded climate (~0.5°) from 1984–2024.  
- **Variables**:  
  - T2M_MAX, T2M_MIN (°C)  
  - PRECTOTCORR_SUM (mm)  
  - TOA radiation (W m⁻²)  
- **Why NASA-POWER?**  
  - Global, consistent coverage  
  - Streamlined API (fast, reliable for interactive public-facing tools)  
  - Alternatives (ERA5, CRU) have higher resolution but slower/more complex access, less suited for live interaction.  

Additional APIs used in the Navigation Pane:  
- [OpenWeather geocoding](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api) for place names.  
- [MAPresso Köppen-Geiger](https://climate.mapresso.com/api/koeppen/) classification.

## Indicators
- **Reference ET₀**: Hargreaves formula (uses TOA, Tmax, Tmin).  
- **Monthly aridity index**: \((ET₀-P)/(ET₀+P)\), ranging from −1 (precipitation surplus) to +1 (evapotranspiration deficit).  
- **Anomalies**:  
  - Compute Z-scores relative to 1984–2024 mean (µ) and σ.  
  - Convert to percentiles using polynomial CDF approximation (Beasley & Springer, 1977).  
  - Percentiles drive visuals and sound.

## Percentile Mapping
- **>50th percentile** = warmer/wetter than mean.  
- **<50th percentile** = cooler/drier than mean.  
- Chart axes normalized **per location** → emphasizes seasonal patterns over regional differences.

## User Adjustments (ΔT, ΔP)
- Users can apply **annual correction factors**: ΔT (°C) and ΔP (mm).  
- Adjustments are applied uniformly across the 12 monthly series.  
- Propagated through:  
  - ET₀ recalculation (temperature)  
  - Aridity index recalculation (precipitation + ET₀)  
- Visuals & sonification update **in real time**.  
- These are **illustrative “what-if” scenarios**, not model-based projections (see *Limitations*).

## Visual & Sound Encoding

### Navigation Pane
- **Map**: cylindrical projection with georeferencing.  
- **Metadata**: Köppen-Geiger code, avg. temp/precip.  
- **Histograms**: monthly anomalies (Tmin, Tmax, Precip).  
- **Poem**: generated by [Llama](https://openrouter.ai/models?q=api), turning anomalies into short verses.  

### Representation Pane
- **Sea waves**: Tmax/Tmin anomalies (color + motion).  
- **Moon**: annual precipitation (size, position, color).  
- **Stars**: monthly aridity (position, halo, spikes/contour, sound pitch).  
- **Sky**: temperature anomaly (brightness, extra stars).  
- **Soundscape**:  
  - Kick drum + chord loop (tempo 80–130 bpm, anomaly-driven).  
  - Drum loops and synth layers intensify with warming.  
  - Stars can be “played” (keys 1–0, O, P); distortions reflect anomalies.

## Development
- Created by the **GeoModel Lab (CREA, Italy)** with expertise in climate science, data analysis, music composition, and visual design.  
- Collaboration with sound/visual artist [**Natan Sinigaglia**](https://natansinigaglia.com/) refined aesthetics and interaction.  
- Iterative prototyping + informal user testing improved interpretability.  

SEAMAN is open-source, available via:
