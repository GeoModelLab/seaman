## Considerations on User Adjustments (ΔT, ΔP)

A further limitation concerns the simplified way in which users can manually adjust annual temperature and precipitation series:

- These modifications are applied as **uniform monthly correction factors**, enabling users to explore the sensitivity of the representation pane to these hypothetical changes.  
- However, such adjustments can generate scenarios that are **not physically plausible**: e.g., a +1.5 °C increase in temperature combined with −200 mm precipitation may not align with regional or global climate model projections.  
- This practice resembles the **incremental or synthetic scenarios** described by the IPCC (1994): useful for sensitivity testing, but not for realistic climate trajectories.  
- While valuable for **illustrative and educational purposes**, these simplified scenarios ignore the coupled dynamics and uncertainty ranges of the climate system (IPCC, 2021).  

👉 The intention is **not** to provide scientifically robust projections, but to offer an **intuitive, experiential way** for non-specialists to engage with “what-if” explorations.  
Integrating model-based scenarios would be a valuable future extension.
